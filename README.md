# Personal Site

This is the source code for (the latest version of) my personal website.

## Building

The theme is assembled by Hugo on build now:

```bash
# Commented out version is first creation of the branch.
# git worktree add --track -b published public/ origin/published
git worktree add public/ origin/published
cd public/ && git switch published && cd ..
hugo
```

## Publishing

The site is published to GitHub Pages as a user site.
The `published` branch will store the rendered site
and the `source` is the main branch for this repo.

The `public/` directory is a [git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree)
pointing to `published` so updates can be published more easily.

```bash
# Remove currently published version.
rm -rf public/*

# Generate the new site.
hugo

# Commit latest version to the published branch.
cd public && git add --all && git commit -m "Publishing to GH Pages" && cd ..

# Publish the new version by pushing published to GitHub
git push --all
